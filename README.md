This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About project

This is a dummy project which contains code to review.

Assumptions:

1. There is a server somewhere which returns required data
2. This project compile and accessible (which is not true, because of lack of the server)
3. All dependecies are installed and met, don't bother with 3d party imports.
4. Testing not required

## Your goal

Your goal is to check the code and provide your review of it using inline or multiline comments.
Assume that your comments will be read by Junior developer, so try to explain at least a bit.
Please use `// REVIEW:` in the code, to mark your comments. It will make my job easier to find this comments.
You shouldn't fix anything, just add comments and send the code with the comments back to me.
